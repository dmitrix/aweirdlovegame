A Weird Love Game
==============

A compo entry for the 28th Ludum Dare.

So... I was struggling for ideas at the beginning of the compo.

"You only get one lover.... lols"

That was my attempt to be all indie or whatever. A unique idea with deep meaning?

I bounced the idea off a friend and he came up with:
"Hmm ok how about there's a love meter that's basically like a timer and the missions are like little tasks you are carrying out to keep her in love with you...
If the meter runs out she leaves you..."

Okay, I tried that... but that's WEIRD!!!! Right??? Too weird, I'm not ready for that. So anyways...
My game took a different direction and now you're a guy who's running away from a girl that's in love with you
or at least she'll make you fall in love with her. Then it's game over. :P
